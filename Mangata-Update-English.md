## Announcement
## At the moment your node will not work properly. Mangata's RPC server (https://avs-aggregator-testnet.mangata.online/) is not working properly. 
## Therefore, it is natural to see RPC Errors in the [CLICK](#Errors) section below.
## There is nothing you can do, we are waiting for an announcement from the team.
## ![resim](https://github.com/Dwtexe/Mangata-AVS/assets/63106683/0342eaa6-1f64-475e-9a68-94620c3d8078)
## If your node is like the picture above, it means that there is no problem, rpc errors will appear on the screen soon, do not worry, you have completed the installation without any problems.
## Announcement over.


# Errors

> 24 hours later, I'm back here.

> Yes, now let's explain the mistakes that everyone asks and does not get tired of asking, and if there are solutions, let's solve them.


### 1 - RPC Errors

> The following errors are called RPC errors. They are not related to you and you will not find a solution even if you try to find one, so stop asking.

> This is a problem that Mangata has to solve, we will wait to hear from them, there is **nothing** can we do.

### 2 - .env Errors

> Let's talk about the second most common errors.

> There is no other possibility that these errors are caused by you!

> This error means that there is an error in your .env file.

> Compare the empty and the final version of the .env file I posted above, and check and recheck until you are sure that you have only changed the parts I said to change properly.

> Some friends forget their passwords and even if every part is correct, they get errors and tear themselves apart. Please be sure of your password.

### 3 - No log progress

> Wait a little, the logs will appear, but they may not appear, at the moment there is an rpc problem that the mangata team needs to fix.

> I don't think there is anyone who runs Node smoothly and error-free.

> Occasionally logs appear, then we get an error, then it seems to be fixed again, etc. So don't worry too much and wait for news from the Mangata team.
